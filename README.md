The **Note-Taking App** is a practical and intuitive mobile application built using **Flutter**, designed to help users easily create, organize, and manage their notes. The app includes features such as adding, editing, deleting notes, and categorizing them. A button-like structure is used for adding sub-headings and organizing content in a hierarchical format, offering an improved user experience for note-taking.

### **Objective**

To develop a responsive, feature-rich, and easy-to-use note-taking app that allows users to manage notes effectively by providing the ability to organize notes with sub-headings and categories.

### **Key Features**

1. **Sub-Headings with Button-Like Structure**  
   - Implement buttons that allow users to add sub-headings to their notes for better organization.
   - Users can add multiple sub-headings under main headings, making it easy to structure lengthy notes.

2. **Note Management**  
   - **Add Notes**: Quick and simple note creation with the ability to format text.
   - **Edit and Delete Notes**: Options to modify or remove notes as needed.
   - **Categories**: Notes can be categorized (e.g., Work, Personal, Reminders) for easy access.

3. **Search Functionality**  
   - **Search Bar**: Users can search for notes by keywords or categories to locate specific information quickly.

4. **Persistent Storage**  
   - **Local Storage**: Notes are saved using SQLite or SharedPreferences, ensuring that notes are not lost even if the app is closed.

5. **UI/UX Design**  
   - Clean, minimalist design focusing on usability and ease of navigation.
   - Use of Material Design with a button-like structure for sub-headings and categories to improve note-taking flow.

6. **Testing & Optimization**  
   - Testing on Android Emulator and physical devices to ensure responsiveness and functionality across various screen sizes.
